About:
- Apple Digital Calculator Clone
- It's not a 100% original UI ( no figma used, only visual )

Some of tested/ learned skills () :
- classes with constructor for a clean and better visibility of the code
- conditional statements
- switch statement
- project created and uploaded with git

Future features to implement:
- limited numbers on the screen
- when many numbers are on the screen, shrink them
